{"name":"Js-fundamentals","tagline":"","body":"# JSFundamentals Course Description\r\n\r\nCome here to solidify your understanding of Objects, Arrays and Functions in JavaScript and learn the common mistakes made by beginners. This is a highly interactive course that uses exercises and projects to drive home these JS Fundamentals. You will finish this course with expert knowledge on one of the most important aspects of the language: objects, arrays and functions. This course is the first of three in the JavaScript Fundamentals series. \r\n\r\n# Course Format\r\n\r\nThe course is taught over four days with one three-hour workshop held each day. Two of these workshops consist of lectures and exercises that check the understanding of the material. The other two workshops are project-based where the fundamental concepts learned are put to use in independent projects with TAs helping each student at their level. The lectures and projects alternate. This course is the first of three in the JavaScript Fundamentals series.\r\n\r\n# Syllabus\r\n\r\n### DAY 1\r\n\r\nMonday (6pm-9pm) Lecture + Exercise Day \r\nTopic: Everything you need to know about Objects + Arrays\r\nSource: https://github.com/bgando/JSFundamentals/blob/master/objectsAndArrays.js\r\n\r\n- basic definitions of objects and arrays\r\n- similarities between objects and arrays\r\n- differences between objects and arrays\r\n- how to add values\r\n- how to access values\r\n- failed property lookup\r\n- special value undefined\r\n- bracket notation\r\n- dot notation and limitations\r\n- special characters in property names\r\n- property/index stringification in arrays\r\n- object lieteral\r\n- looping through objects and arrays\r\n- length doesn't hold non-integer properties\r\n- definition of method\r\n- native methods and constructors of objects and arrays\r\n\r\n### DAY 2\r\n\r\nTuesday (6pm-9pm) Project Day\r\nTopic: Today you will work with your pair on a project that utilizes Objects + Arrays\r\nSource: https://github.com/bgando/JSFundamentals/blob/master/Day2Challenges.js\r\n\r\n- console.log\r\n- loop\r\n- push\r\n- join\r\n- pop\r\n- Array.isArray\r\n- control flow\r\n- length\r\n\r\n### DAY 3\r\n\r\nWednesday (6pm-9pm) Lecture + Exercise Day \r\nTopic: Today we will straighten out common confusions related to functions with exercises intertwined\r\nSource:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### DAY 4\r\n\r\nThursday (6pm-9pm) Project Day\r\nTopic: Today you will work with your pair to tie everything together for your final project. \r\nSource: \r\n\r\n\r\n## Goals of this course\r\n\r\nThe goal of the JavaScript Fundamentals 1, 2 and 3 - collectively called Hack Reactor Junior (HRJR) classes - is to give technical foundation and support for those who have been learning JavaScript for a couple of months, so that they will have reached a level required for the Hack Reactor admission's interviews.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT*: completion of the HRJR courses is no guarantee of admission, nor has any influence in the admissions process.\r\n\r\nIt is our goal, however, that students who successfully complete the HRJR series will have covered all JavaScript topics necessary for the interview.\r\n\r\nIf Hack Reactor takes people from 60 to 120 in web development, then Hack Reactor Junior takes people from 10 to 60 ('coz we don't teach variables and the like).\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nStudents should have 1-2 months experience with JavaScript and programming, about the level of Codecademy. Students should understand and be familiar with variables, if/else statements, for loops and the most basic of JavaScript syntax.\r\n\r\n## Textbook\r\n\r\nNo textbook is required for this course. All materials are included in this github repo.\r\n\r\n## Technical requirements\r\n\r\nLaptop, Chrome browser and a text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 3 for this course becuase its fast, light weight and you can run your JavaScript files in its console with Node.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array\r\n\r\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis course was created by Bianca Gondolfo @bgando.
